# Plans for the project

With the C implementation mostly complete, the project's next phase focuses on extreme performance. I am now rebuilding the library in C++ to leverage object-oriented design and integrating CUDA for GPU acceleration. The custom math functions will be replaced by optimized BLAS routines, and the core data structures will be extended to support N-dimensional tensors for more advanced models.
