# Neural Network in C

A from-scratch implementation of a simple neural network, written entirely in C. This project is a foundational exploration into building low-level deep learning algorithms.

---

## Project Goals

This project was built to explore the fundamental algorithms that power modern deep learning. The primary goals include:

* Gaining a deep understanding of core neural network concepts (feedforward, backpropagation, and gradient descent).
* Implementing and optimizing linear algebra operations from the ground up.
* Building a clean, well-documented, and production-ready library.
* Learning best practices for C development, including memory management, build systems, and defensive programming.

## Project Structure

* `src/`: Contains all C source files (`.c`), which hold the implementation of the neural network components.
* `include/`: Contains all C header files (`.h`), which provide the public interface for the library.
